## Description
Official implementation of Cell Local Environment Neighborhood Scan (CellLENS), a computational method that learns a single-cell representation embedding by integrating cross-domain information from tissue samples.
Through the analysis of datasets spanning spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we demonstrate CellLENSâ€™s capability to elucidate biologically relevant cell populations that were previously elusive due to the relinquished tissue morphological information from images. For more details, see our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.12.593710v1).


NOTE: this repository is under active development, and the current version is only meant for <ins>reviewing and early access testing etc</ins>. We will provide more detailed installation instruction and tutorial soon.

## Installation
CellLENS is hosted on `pypi` and can be installed via `pip`. We recommend working with a fresh virtual environment. In the following example we use conda. Note our package requires the availability of `CUDA` on the machine, since it uses `pyTorch`.

```
conda create -n celllens python=3.9 # create a new vm
conda activate celllens # activate celllens vm
pip install celllens==0.1.0 # install celllens in vm
```
After installation, you can import the module via
```
import celllens
```
For details of the use of CellLENS, please refer to the tutorials.
