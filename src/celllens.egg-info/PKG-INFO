Official implementation of Cell Local Environment Neighborhood Scan (CellLENS), a computational method that learns a single-cell representation embedding by integrating cross-domain information from tissue samples. Through the analysis of datasets spanning spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we demonstrate CellLENSâ€™s capability to elucidate biologically relevant cell populations that were previously elusive due to the relinquished tissue morphological information from images
